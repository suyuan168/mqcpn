Multipath QUIC VPN using [MASQUE CONNECT-IP (RFC 9484)](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9484) over [HTTP Datagrams (RFC 9297)](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9297) / [QUIC DATAGRAMs (RFC 9221)](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9221), built on a [fork of XQUIC](https://github.com/mp0rta/xquic/tree/mqvpn-main) with [Multipath QUIC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-quic-multipath/).

## Features

- **Multipath** — Bind multiple interfaces (WiFi + LTE, dual ISP). Seamless failover and bandwidth aggregation via WLB or WRTT scheduler.
- **Standards-based** — MASQUE CONNECT-IP (RFC 9484), no proprietary tunnel format.
- **Dual-stack** — IPv4 + IPv6 inside the tunnel.
- **Multi-Platform** — Available on Linux (server/client), Windows (client only), macOS (client only) and Android (client only) support.
- **PSK auth** — Pre-shared key over TLS 1.3.
- **DNS override** — Prevents DNS leaks. Uses `resolvectl` on systemd-resolved systems, falls back to resolv.conf.

## Installation

### Server

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/mp0rta/mqvpn.git
cd mqvpn && ./build.sh

# Server
sudo scripts/start_server.sh
# → Generated auth key example: mPyVpoQWcp/5gr404xvS19aRC03o0XS2mrb2tZJ1Ii4=

# Client (single path)
sudo ./build/mqvpn --mode client --server 203.0.113.1:443 \
    --auth-key mPyVpoQWcp/5gr404xvS19aRC03o0XS2mrb2tZJ1Ii4= --insecure

# Client (multipath)
sudo ./build/mqvpn --mode client --server 203.0.113.1:443 \
    --auth-key mPyVpoQWcp/5gr404xvS19aRC03o0XS2mrb2tZJ1Ii4= --path eth0 --path wlan0 --insecure

# Client (multipath + backup failover path)
sudo ./build/mqvpn --mode client --server 203.0.113.1:443 \
    --auth-key mPyVpoQWcp/5gr404xvS19aRC03o0XS2mrb2tZJ1Ii4= --path eth0 --backup-path lte0 --insecure

# Client (with DNS override)
sudo ./build/mqvpn --mode client --server 203.0.113.1:443 \
    --auth-key mPyVpoQWcp/5gr404xvS19aRC03o0XS2mrb2tZJ1Ii4= --dns 1.1.1.1 --dns 8.8.8.8 --insecure

# Server (dual-stack — IPv4 + IPv6)
sudo scripts/start_server.sh --subnet 10.0.0.0/24 --subnet6 fd00:abcd::/112
```

This downloads the latest release, installs the binary, and generates a self-signed TLS certificate, auth key, and server config at `/etc/mqvpn/server.conf`. Add `--start` to start the server and register it for automatic startup on boot:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/mp0rta/mqvpn/releases/latest/download/install.sh \
    | sudo bash -s -- --start
```

> **Note:** The self-signed certificate requires `--insecure` on the client. For production, replace with a trusted certificate (e.g. Let's Encrypt) and omit `--insecure`.

Options can be combined:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/mp0rta/mqvpn/releases/latest/download/install.sh \
    | sudo bash -s -- --start --port 10020 --subnet 10.8.0.0/24
```

Uninstall: re-run the install script with `--uninstall`.
```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/mp0rta/mqvpn/releases/latest/download/install.sh \
    | sudo bash -s -- --uninstall
```

### Client (deb package)

Download the latest `.deb` from [Releases](https://github.com/mp0rta/mqvpn/releases/latest):

```bash
# Replace VERSION and ARCH as needed (e.g., 0.6.0, amd64)
curl -LO https://github.com/mp0rta/mqvpn/releases/latest/download/mqvpn_VERSION_ARCH.deb
sudo dpkg -i mqvpn_*.deb
```

### Windows client

Pre-built binaries are shipped for Windows amd64 and arm64. Download `mqvpn_<VERSION>_windows_<ARCH>.zip` from [Releases](https://github.com/mp0rta/mqvpn/releases/latest), extract, and follow the bundled `README.txt` (admin PowerShell required).

### macOS client

Pre-built binaries are shipped for Apple silicon (arm64). Download `mqvpn_<VERSION>_darwin_arm64.tar.gz` from [Releases](https://github.com/mp0rta/mqvpn/releases/latest), extract, and follow the bundled `README.txt` (sudo required).

## Quick Start

After installing the server and client (see [Installation](#installation)):

```bash
# Client (single path)
sudo mqvpn --mode client --server YOUR_SERVER:443 \
    --auth-key YOUR_AUTH_KEY --insecure

# Client (multipath)
sudo mqvpn --mode client --server YOUR_SERVER:443 \
    --auth-key YOUR_AUTH_KEY --path eth0 --path wlan0 --insecure

# Client (with DNS override)
sudo mqvpn --mode client --server YOUR_SERVER:443 \
    --auth-key YOUR_AUTH_KEY --dns 1.1.1.1 --dns 8.8.8.8 --insecure
```

> **Notes:**
> - On Linux, without `--path`, the client uses the default interface (single path); multipath requires two or more `--path` flags. On Windows, `--path` is always required (one or more); see `docs/windows_build.md`.
> - The server needs its listen port open for UDP (default: 443). All client traffic is routed through the tunnel.

## Configuration

Config files support both INI and JSON. CLI arguments override config values.

### JSON config

The loader auto-detects JSON files (first non-space char is `{`).

Server example:

```json
{
    "mode": "server",
    "listen": "0.0.0.0:443",
    "subnet": "10.0.0.0/24",
    "subnet6": "fd00:abcd::/112",
    "cert_file": "/etc/mqvpn/server.crt",
    "key_file": "/etc/mqvpn/server.key",
    "cipher": "TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256:TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384",
    "auth_key": "legacy-fallback-key",
    "users": [
        { "name": "alice", "key": "alice-secret" },
        { "name": "carol", "key": "carol-secret", "fixed_ip": "10.0.0.50" },
        "bob:bob-secret"
    ],
    "max_clients": 64,
    "scheduler": "wlb",
    "cc": "bbr2",
    "fec_enable": true,
    "fec_scheme": "reed_solomon",
    "mtu": 1280,
    "control_port": 9090,
    "control_addr": "127.0.0.1"
}
```

Client example:

```json
{
    "mode": "client",
    "server_addr": "203.0.113.1:443",
    "tls_server_name": "vpn.example.com",
    "auth_key": "client-key",
    "auth_username": "alice",
    "cipher": "TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256:TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256",
    "insecure": false,
    "dns": ["1.1.1.1", "8.8.8.8"],
    "paths": ["eth0", "wlan0"],
    "backup_paths": ["lte0"],
    "reconnect": true,
    "reconnect_interval": 5,
    "kill_switch": false,
    "route_via_server": false,
    "no_routes": false,
    "scheduler": "wlb",
    "cc": "bbr2",
    "mtu": 1280,
    "reinjection_control": true,
    "reinjection_mode": "deadline",
    "fec_enable": true,
    "fec_scheme": "xor",
    "control_port": 0,
    "control_addr": "127.0.0.1"
}
```

Notes:
- `users` is server-side auth and accepts either objects (`{"name","key"}` or `{"name","key","fixed_ip"}`) or `"name:key"` strings.
- A `fixed_ip` in a user object pins that IPv4 address to the user. The address is removed from the dynamic pool at startup and never assigned to other clients. The INI equivalent is `User = name:key:fixed_ip`.
- `auth_key` remains supported as a single legacy/global key.
- `auth_username` is client-side only: the name sent to the server for identification in logs and status output. It does not affect authentication.
- `mode` is optional if it can be inferred (`listen` implies server).
- `manage_routes` defaults to `true`; set it to `false` on router/embedded integrations where an external orchestrator owns the host routing table and mqvpn should only bring up the TUN.
- **[mqvpn-prometheus-exporter](https://github.com/mp0rta/mqvpn-prometheus-exporter) requires per-user keys.** Using mqvpn-prometheus-exporter, you can correct and visualize mqvpn metrics. If you use it, sharing a single `auth_key` across
  multiple clients works for the VPN data plane, but the control API
  surfaces those sessions as `user="(global)"` and the Prometheus exporter
  cannot distinguish them — series labels collide and the scrape is
  dropped. For multi-client deployments register each client under `users`
  (or via `add_user` over the control API) so each gets a distinct `user`
  label.

```bash
sudo mqvpn --config /etc/mqvpn/server.conf
sudo mqvpn --config /etc/mqvpn/client.conf
```

## Schedulers

| Scheduler       | TCP              | UDP              | Typical use                                               |
|-----------------|------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `minrtt`        | min RTT          | min RTT          | latency-first                                             |
| `wlb` (default) | flow pin         | unpinned         | general use; UDP packets distributed per-packet           |
| `wlb_udp_pin`   | flow pin         | flow pin         | each UDP connection kept on a single path                 |
| `wrtt`          | weight × RTT     | weight × RTT     | weighted aggregation; RTT as tiebreaker when weights equal |
| `backup_fec`    | redundant        | redundant        | resilience-first (requires XQC_ENABLE_FEC)                |

**Choosing wlb vs wlb_udp_pin:** Plain `wlb` distributes UDP packets across
paths per-packet, which gives better aggregate throughput when the inner
protocol tolerates reorder. Some inner UDP protocols, however, maintain their
own packet ordering and may treat reorder as packet loss — under asymmetric-RTT
paths this can slow them down and throughput drops. `wlb_udp_pin` keeps each
UDP connection on a single path to avoid that case. If you observe degraded UDP
throughput under `wlb`, try `wlb_udp_pin`; otherwise `wlb` is the better
default.

**Trade-off note (`wlb_udp_pin`):** the xquic WLB flow table is a fixed 4096-entry
open-addressed structure with 60s idle eviction. Workloads with very high
short-flow UDP churn (e.g. high-rate DNS, mDNS bursts) may evict longer-lived
inner flows under probe-region pressure. `wlb_udp_pin` is intended for tunnels
carrying a small-to-moderate set of long-lived inner UDP flows; high-churn UDP
profiles are better served by `wlb`.

**`wrtt` — weighted RTT scheduler:** each packet is sent on the path with the
best weight-to-RTT score. When weights are equal, the lowest-RTT path leads.
When weights differ, the higher-weight path dominates even if its RTT is worse.
When the preferred path is congestion-limited, traffic spills over to secondary
paths automatically (cwnd-block fallback). Path weights are set at runtime via
`set_path_weight` (see [Client commands](#client-commands) below). Use `wrtt`
when you need fine-grained per-link preference in addition to aggregation — for
example, to prioritise a high-bandwidth fibre link over a metered LTE backup
while still drawing on both under load.

## Reorder buffer (datagram lane)

A single inner UDP/QUIC flow striped across paths with different RTTs arrives
reordered, and many inner protocols treat reorder as loss and back off. The
reorder buffer holds datagrams in a short receive-side window and releases them
in order, so one inner flow can aggregate both paths — the datagram-lane
counterpart to what the [hybrid TCP stream lane](#hybrid-mode-tcp-lane) does for
TCP. Off by default; negotiated end-to-end (both client and server must enable
it) and a no-op when either side has it off.

```ini
[Reorder]
Enabled = on
MaxWaitMs = 50           # reorder window: hold out-of-order datagrams up to this long
CapPackets = 1024        # per-flow buffer cap (packets)

# Optional: target specific inner flows with a tuned preset
[ReorderRule]
Proto = udp
Port = 443
Profile = cellular_bond  # cellular_bond (wait=50ms, cap=1024) | fiber_lte (wait=50ms, cap=2048)
```

INI/JSON only (no CLI flag). Best on asymmetric-RTT path pairs (e.g. Wi-Fi +
LTE); for symmetric, loss-dominated paths leave it off. See
[docs/report/](docs/report/) for the parameter sweep and measured numbers.

## Hybrid mode (TCP lane)

Optionally terminates inner TCP connections locally (embedded lwIP) and relays them over a dedicated HTTP/3 request stream instead of the datagram CONNECT-IP path — trades small per-flow overhead for multipath TCP aggregation (see docs/report/ for measured numbers).

```
TUN packet
  │
  ▼
classifier (per packet: protocol + Tcp mode + tunnel-subnet carve-out)
  │
  ├─ IPv4 TCP, Tcp=stream (or Tcp=auto with ≥2 active paths)
  │     └─▶ tcp lane (client-side lwIP) ─▶ HTTP/3 request stream ─▶ server egress connect()
  ├─ UDP (parseable)
  │     └─▶ datagram lane (existing reorder/STAMP path) ─▶ CONNECT-IP DATAGRAM
  └─ everything else (incl. TCP under Tcp=raw, or Tcp=auto with <2 active paths)
        └─▶ raw lane (existing, unchanged) ─▶ CONNECT-IP DATAGRAM
```

```ini
[Hybrid]
Enabled = true
Tcp = auto              # stream | raw | auto (per-flow: TCP lane once >=2 paths are active)
TcpMaxFlows = 256        # concurrent TCP-lane flow cap (client) / per-session cap (server)
EgressAllow = 10.0.5.0/24  # server: punch a hole through the default-deny egress ACL
```

Disabled by default; existing users see no behavior change. See
[docs/control-api.md §9](docs/control-api.md#9-hybrid-mode-configuration-keys)
for the full `[Hybrid]` config key reference and the `get_stats` counters
this mode exposes.

## systemd

```bash
# Server
sudo cp /etc/mqvpn/server.conf.example /etc/mqvpn/server.conf
sudo vi /etc/mqvpn/server.conf   # edit cert/key paths, auth key, etc.
sudo systemctl enable --now mqvpn-server

# Client (template — instance name maps to config file)
sudo cp /etc/mqvpn/client.conf.example /etc/mqvpn/client-home.conf
sudo vi /etc/mqvpn/client-home.conf   # edit server address, auth key, etc.
sudo systemctl enable --now mqvpn-client@home
```

## Control API

Both the server and the client can be managed at runtime over a TCP port using newline-delimited JSON.

Control API: see [docs/control-api.md](docs/control-api.md) for the full wire-protocol reference (all 8 commands, request/response schemas, error strings).

### Enable

The control API is **disabled by default**. Enable it via any of the following:

#### From `install.sh`

```bash
sudo bash install.sh --enable-control            # port 9090
sudo bash install.sh --enable-control 9091
```

#### From INI (`/etc/mqvpn/server.conf`)

```ini
[Control]
Listen = 127.0.0.1:9090
```

#### From JSON (`/etc/mqvpn/server.json`)

```json
{
  "control_listen": "127.0.0.1:9090"
}
```

#### From CLI (per-field override of the config file)

```bash
# Server — CLI
sudo mqvpn --mode server ... --control-port 9090

# Server — config file ([Control] section)
# Port = 9090
# Addr = 127.0.0.1

# Client — CLI
sudo mqvpn --mode client ... --control-port 9091

# Client — config file ([Control] section)
# Port = 9091
# Addr = 127.0.0.1
```

> **Security:** bind only to `127.0.0.1` (the default) unless the port is protected by a firewall or network policy. The control API has no authentication.

### Commands

#### Add a user

```bash
echo '{"cmd":"add_user","name":"carol","key":"carol-secret"}' | nc 127.0.0.1 9090
```
```json
{"ok":true}
```

Calling `add_user` with an existing name updates the key in place.

To add a user with a fixed (pinned) IP that is permanently reserved for that user:

```bash
echo '{"cmd":"add_user","name":"carol","key":"carol-secret","fixed_ip":"10.0.0.50"}' | nc 127.0.0.1 9090
```

#### Set or clear a fixed IP for a user

Assign a fixed IP to an existing user at runtime. The address is removed from the dynamic pool and reserved exclusively for that user from the next connection onward.

```bash
echo '{"cmd":"set_user_fixed_ip","name":"carol","fixed_ip":"10.0.0.50"}' | nc 127.0.0.1 9090
```
```json
{"ok":true}
```

Pass `"fixed_ip":""` to remove the reservation and return the address to the dynamic pool:

```bash
echo '{"cmd":"set_user_fixed_ip","name":"carol","fixed_ip":""}' | nc 127.0.0.1 9090
```

#### Remove a user

```bash
echo '{"cmd":"remove_user","name":"carol"}' | nc 127.0.0.1 9090
```
```json
{"ok":true}
```

#### List users

```bash
echo '{"cmd":"list_users"}' | nc 127.0.0.1 9090
```
```json
{"ok":true,"users":["alice","bob"]}
```

#### Get stats

```bash
echo '{"cmd":"get_stats"}' | nc 127.0.0.1 9090
```
```json
{"ok":true,"n_clients":2,"bytes_tx":983040,"bytes_rx":458752}
```

#### Error response

```json
{"ok":false,"error":"user not found"}
```

### Client commands

#### Add a path

```bash
echo '{"cmd":"add_path","iface":"wlan0"}' | nc 127.0.0.1 9091
```
```json
{"ok":true}
```

To add a backup (failover-only) path:

```bash
echo '{"cmd":"add_path","iface":"lte0","backup":true}' | nc 127.0.0.1 9091
```

#### Remove a path

```bash
echo '{"cmd":"remove_path","iface":"wlan0"}' | nc 127.0.0.1 9091
```
```json
{"ok":true}
```

Removing the last remaining path is rejected with an error.

#### List paths

```bash
echo '{"cmd":"list_paths"}' | nc 127.0.0.1 9091
```
```json
{"ok":true,"paths":["eth0","wlan0"]}
```

#### Set path weight

Set the scheduler weight for a path. Only effective with the `wrtt` scheduler.
Higher weight directs more traffic to that path; when weights are equal, the
lowest-RTT path is preferred. Weight `0` resets to the default (equivalent to
`1`). Valid range: `0`–`65535`.

```bash
echo '{"cmd":"set_path_weight","iface":"eth0","weight":10}' | nc 127.0.0.1 9091
```
```json
{"ok":true}
```

Example — prioritise `eth0` (fibre) over `wlan0` (WiFi) while keeping both active:

```bash
echo '{"cmd":"set_path_weight","iface":"eth0","weight":10}' | nc 127.0.0.1 9091
echo '{"cmd":"set_path_weight","iface":"wlan0","weight":1}' | nc 127.0.0.1 9091
```

> **Note:** weights take effect once each path has completed its QUIC
> PATH_CHALLENGE/RESPONSE handshake and reached the `active` state. Calling
> `set_path_weight` before paths are active is accepted but the weight is applied
> as soon as the path activates.

### From code (Python example)

```python
import socket, json

def ctrl(port, cmd):
    with socket.create_connection(("127.0.0.1", port)) as s:
        s.sendall((json.dumps(cmd) + "\n").encode())
        return json.loads(s.makefile().readline())

ctrl(9090, {"cmd": "add_user",          "name": "dave", "key": "dave-secret"})
ctrl(9090, {"cmd": "add_user",          "name": "eve",  "key": "eve-secret", "fixed_ip": "10.0.0.50"})
ctrl(9090, {"cmd": "set_user_fixed_ip", "name": "dave", "fixed_ip": "10.0.0.51"})
ctrl(9090, {"cmd": "set_user_fixed_ip", "name": "dave", "fixed_ip": ""})  # clear
ctrl(9090, {"cmd": "remove_user",       "name": "dave"})
print(ctrl(9090, {"cmd": "list_users"}))   # {'ok': True, 'users': ['alice', 'bob', 'eve']}
print(ctrl(9090, {"cmd": "get_stats"}))    # {'ok': True, 'n_clients': 1, ...}

# WRTT weight control (client port)
ctrl(9091, {"cmd": "set_path_weight", "iface": "eth0",  "weight": 10})
ctrl(9091, {"cmd": "set_path_weight", "iface": "wlan0", "weight": 1})
```

| WLB vs MinRTT | WLB **+21%** |

### Hybrid TCP-lane (v0.9.0)

Symmetric 2×100 Mbit / 25 ms, TCP uplink, `iperf3 -P {1,2,4,8,16}`, 3 reps. The hybrid TCP **stream lane** terminates TCP at the client and relays it in-order over a QUIC STREAM, so even a single flow aggregates both paths — where raw multipath (datagram tunneling) makes one flow back off on cross-path reorder. Hybrid ON reaches **~187 Mbps** (≈93 % of the 200 Mbps aggregate) at *every* stream count:

| WLB, streams (`-P`) | 1 | 2 | 4 | 8 | 16 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| hybrid OFF (raw) | 96 | 177 | 167 | 177 | 178 |
| hybrid ON (lane) | **187** | 186 | 188 | 188 | 188 |
| gain | **+95 %** | +5 % | +12 % | +6 % | +6 % |
