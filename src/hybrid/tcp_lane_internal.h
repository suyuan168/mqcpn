 * tcp_lane_internal.h — shared internal seam between tcp_lane.c (flow
 * table, accept callback, downlink relay, close/error mapping) and
 * tcp_lane_uplink.c (uplink queue + send + flush + FIN machinery).
 *
 * Split out once tcp_lane.c crossed the file's ~800-line extraction
 * trigger: the two .c files are logically ONE module, just divided for
 * size hygiene. This header is NOT part of the public API (src/hybrid/ is
 * internal to libmqvpn already; this header is internal to tcp_lane.c's own
 * pair of TUs) — it holds:
 *   - the mqvpn_tcp_flow_t / uplink-node struct layouts both TUs need full
 *     visibility into (tcp_lane.h's public surface stays lwIP-opaque);
 *   - the MQVPN_TCP_LANE_TEST_* compile-time hook macros (test-double
 *     substitution idiom — see each macro's comment below), which must
 *     apply identically to code in BOTH TUs;
 *   - the small set of cross-TU function declarations (each documented at
 *     its declaration below).
 *
 * test_tcp_lane.c #include's both tcp_lane.c and tcp_lane_uplink.c into one
 * translation unit (same idiom test_reorder_rx.c uses for a single file) —
 * it must #define every hook macro below BEFORE either #include so the
 * #ifndef guards here pick up the test doubles instead of the real lwIP
 * calls (calling the real tcp_recved/tcp_write/tcp_shutdown/tcp_output/
 * tcp_abort/tcp_close on the test's stack-fake `struct tcp_pcb`s would
 * touch pool/list internals never initialized by a real tcp_new()+accept —
 * see each hook's comment).
