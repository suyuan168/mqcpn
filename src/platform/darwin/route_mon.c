 * route_mon.c — PF_ROUTE link/address monitor + path recovery accelerator

 * periodic recovery timer that backstops missed one-shot events.
 *
 * Split out of platform_darwin.c so the reactor skeleton there stays free

 * netlink_mon.c reactor, byte-diffed against it function by function so
 * the two accelerators drift apart only where the kernel ABI forces it.
