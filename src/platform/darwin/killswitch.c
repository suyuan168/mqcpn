 * killswitch.c — pf anchor kill switch for Darwin, twin of
 * linux/killswitch.c (iptables).
 *
 * Blocks all outbound traffic outside the VPN tunnel via a pf anchor
 * ("com.apple/250.mqvpn") loaded through `pfctl -a <anchor> -f -`. Rule
 * semantics (allow tun / allow lo / allow UDP-to-server / drop rest, with
 * the two-axis IPv4/IPv6 family gating) are copied EXACTLY from
 * linux/killswitch.c:48-113 — this is a syntax port, not a policy change.
 * In particular the KNOWN gap is inherited as-is: a v4-only tunnel with no
 * v6 config does NOT block native v6 traffic (no utun-inet6 pass rule is
 * ever emitted in that case, so nothing here stops v6 from routing around
 * the tunnel via the host's normal v6 route). Do not fix this unilaterally
 * in a Darwin-only slice — it's a cross-platform follow-up.
 *
 * VERIFIED on real macOS 26.5 (arm64) — three items, each also flagged at
 * its exact use site below:
 *   1. macOS's stock /etc/pf.conf DOES evaluate anchors under the
 *      "com.apple/" prefix: `pfctl -sr` lists a wildcard com.apple anchor in
 *      the main ruleset, and rules loaded into "com.apple/250.mqvpn" actually
 *      block traffic (curl bound to a physical IF fails while tunnel/lo0/
 *      QUIC-to-server pass). The whole wiring strategy works end to end.
 *   2. `pfctl -E`'s "Token : <N>" line is printed on STDERR (confirmed by
 *      redirecting stdout to /dev/null) with that exact "Token : " prefix;
 *      observed tokens are 19-20 decimal digits (uint64), well within
 *      ks_pf_token[24]. run_pfctl_capture merges both streams anyway.
 *   3. `pfctl -X <token>` precisely releases the enable reference (post-
 *      shutdown `pfctl -s References` returns to "No pf starter references
 *      held"); and the token-less crash path leaves a safe state — a
 *      kill -9'd killswitch instance leaks its enable reference (pf stays
 *      Enabled) but the startup anchor flush removes every rule, so traffic
 *      flows and the lingering +1 reference is harmless (see
 *      cleanup_killswitch()).
 *
 * Anchor rules are NOT tied to this process's lifetime: pf state lives in
 * the kernel, so a crashed mqvpn leaves the anchor (and, if this process
 * was also the one that ran `pfctl -E`, pf itself) resident and blocking
 * — fail-closed by design, the same as Linux's iptables rules surviving a
 * crash. kill_switch_flush_stale_anchor() below is the self-recovery path;
 * it is wired into the startup stale-recovery block in
 * darwin_platform_run_client, not called from
 * setup_killswitch() — see kill_switch_flush_stale_anchor()'s doc comment
 * for why it cannot live inside setup_killswitch().

 * otherwise inert (lo0/tun/server-udp match disjoint traffic), so this
 * builder always emits them as: lo0 pass, [tun pass], [server pass],
 * block — same shape for both inet and inet6.
 *
 * inet (v4) is unconditional: lo0 pass, tun pass, [server pass iff the
 * server is v4], block.
 *
 * inet6 is emitted only when `is_v6` (server is v6) or `has_v6` (tunnel
 * carries v6) — this single guarded block is algebraically equivalent to
 * the Linux code's two separately-triggered branches (verified case by
 * case against killswitch.c:70-112; see the gating truth table in the
 * task report / commit message):
 *   - the tun pass line is gated on `has_v6` alone (Linux's
 *     "IPv6 data plane TUN rule" block, killswitch.c:97-101);
 *   - the server pass line is gated on `is_v6` alone (Linux's
 *     `else { ip6tables ... }` branch, killswitch.c:79-94);
 *   - lo0 pass + block are gated on `is_v6 || has_v6`: Linux emits them
 *     unconditionally inside the is_v6 branch (killswitch.c:84-90), and
 *     AGAIN inside the has_v6 branch but only `if (!is_v6)`
 *     (killswitch.c:102-111) — so across all four (is_v6, has_v6)
 *     combinations they appear exactly once whenever is_v6 OR has_v6 is
 *     true, and never when both are false.
 *
 * Uses a plain host match ("to <ip>") rather than Linux's explicit
 * "<ip>/<prefix>" CIDR for the server exception — pf's `to <addr>` with no
 * mask already matches that single host only (default /32 or /128), so
 * this is a syntax simplification, not a policy change.
