# test_e2e_hybrid_h2.sh — Netns end-to-end test for hybrid mode H2 (real
# TCP-lane transport: client-side lwIP termination <-> server-side egress
# relay). This is the FIRST point where the independently-built client
# (lwIP + tcp_lane request builder) and server (auth/ACL/connect/relay)
# sides actually talk to each other over a live tunnel.
#
# What this verifies:
#   Test 1 (curl body correctness), Tcp=stream:
#     - a real HTTP server, reachable only through the tunnel's hybrid TCP
#       relay (NOT the CONNECT-IP subnet, NOT the VPN transport address),
#       serves a known file; curl fetches it FROM the client netns and the
#       body is compared byte-for-byte against the source file. Exit-code
#       success alone is not accepted as a PASS (session-1 lesson): the
#       comparison IS the server-side-bytes verification this test hinges
#       on.
#     - the client [STATUS] line additionally confirms the TCP lane was
#       actually exercised (nonzero tcp counter), not merely that curl
#       happened to work over some other path.
#   Test 7 (byte-identical regression), two phases:
#     Phase A [Hybrid] Enabled=false:
#       - inner ping + TCP transfer through the CONNECT-IP tunnel (as H1),
#         but strengthened to a full byte-for-byte compare of a random
#         payload (not just nc's exit code).
#     Phase B [Hybrid] Enabled=true / Tcp=raw:
#       - same byte-identical transfer (still travels the CONNECT-IP path,
#         since Tcp=raw makes the classifier route TCP as RAW — see
#         classifier.c). PLUS: the client's tcp lane counter must stay at
#         0 for the whole run (classifier never yields LANE_TCP under
#         Tcp=raw, so nothing ever reaches lwIP — see the note by
#         LANE_TCP_ASSERTION below), and the server's tcp_flows_active must
#         read 0 via the control API — a real wiring check now that
#         mqvpn_server_get_stats populates the field from the live
#         tcp_egress_global_fd_count (Test 1b is the companion off-zero
#         proof for the same field).
#   Test 2 (single-path throughput), two phases, single path, unshaped:
#     Phase A [Hybrid] Enabled=true / Tcp=raw: iperf3 through the plain
#       CONNECT-IP tunnel (RAW_MBPS baseline).
#     Phase B [Hybrid] Enabled=true / Tcp=stream + EgressAllow: iperf3
#       through the hybrid TCP-lane relay to the same egress-allowed target
#       Test 1 uses (STREAM_MBPS). Asserts the stream lane costs <=20% of
#       RAW — the mqproxy reference impl's TCP-over-stream overhead at
#       single path (docs/report/2026-06-23).
#   Test 3 (multipath aggregation): same stream-lane config as Test 2 Phase
#     B, under an asymmetric two-path netem profile (bench_env_setup.sh's
#     BENCH_ENV_NETEM table). Compares a single-path baseline (Path A's leg
#     of the profile only) against both paths active, and asserts the
#     2-path number is >=1.5x the single-path number — proof the WLB
#     scheduler's aggregation survives the stream lane (mqproxy reference:
#     1.81x single-flow 2-path aggregation; 1.5x leaves margin for variance
#     while still ruling out non-aggregating ~1.0x).
#   Test 4 (TCP half-close, asymmetric-close row): a client half-closes its
#     write side (shutdown(SHUT_WR)) but keeps reading; a server-side
#     responder deliberately waits for the peer's FIN before replying, then
#     closes. The reply only arrives if the half-close survived end-to-end
#     through the client's lwIP termination and the server's egress relay
#     (src/hybrid/tcp_egress.c's shutdown(fd, SHUT_WR) forwarding) — a real
#     kernel TCP semantic no fake-double unit test can exercise.
#   Test 5 (RST propagation, abortive-close row): an egress-side target sets
#     SO_LINGER{1,0} and closes on SIGTERM, forcing the kernel to emit a real
#     RST (not an incidental FIN) while the connection is live and flowing.
#     Asserts the client-side reader (a) saw real data before the abort
#     (proves "flowing", ruling out a same-shaped false pass from never
#     connecting) and (b) tears down promptly (<5s, far under the 300s
#     tcp_idle_timeout_sec default) — proof the RST propagates through the
#     server's RESET_STREAM error-mapping rather than the client hanging
#     toward the idle-eviction sweep.
#   Test 6 (tcp=auto sticky per-flow lane decision across a live path
#     bring-up): the one test that exercises the whole sticky-lane invariant
#     end-to-end — active_paths_count(c) >= 2 (src/mqvpn_client.c) is
#     snapshotted ONCE per flow at SYN time (hybrid_tcp_syn_policy) and
#     latched into the flow table; it must never be re-consulted for that
#     flow again, no matter how the path count changes later.
#       Topology: both path slots' veth pairs exist from the start (both
#       --path args are given at client startup, satisfying the ifname-
#       resolves check in platform_linux.c — see that file's iface-pin
#       failure path), but path 1's CLIENT-side interface starts
#       administratively down. This guarantees active_paths_count()==1
#       structurally (a down link cannot complete PATH_CHALLENGE) with no
#       polling/race needed, until the test explicitly `ip link set up`s it.
#       flow_a opens (continuous sender, target 10.222.0.1 — outside the
#       tunnel subnet, so the classifier's tunnel-subnet-forces-RAW carve-out
#       cannot mask this measurement) while only 1 path is up: tcp=auto must
#       route it sticky-RAW. Path 1 is then brought up live and its
#       activation is confirmed via the "path[1] activated" log line (the
#       client runs no control API, so this is the only external signal of
#       active_paths_count() crossing 2 — see the investigation note below).
#       flow_b then opens (same target, same continuous-sender contract)
#       with 2 paths active: tcp=auto must route it onto the real TCP lane.
#       Observability: this test predates a fix to the client's [STATUS]
#       `lanes tcp/dgram/raw=T/D/R` counter — c->pkts_lane_tcp used to be
#       bumped by mqvpn_hybrid_classify() the moment a packet was classified
#       as TCP-protocol/non-excluded, BEFORE the per-flow sticky verdict was
#       consulted, so it incremented identically for a sticky-RAW flow and a
#       real TCP-lane flow under tcp=auto. pkts_lane_tcp is now bumped only
#       once the verdict resolves to "feed lwIP" (src/mqvpn_client.c's
#       tun_decide_lane), so it WOULD distinguish the two cases today — but
#       this test still uses the peer-address method below as its primary
#       proof (more direct: it observes which endpoint the connection
#       actually reached, not just a packet-classification side effect):
#       a sticky-RAW flow
#       is an unmodified, kernel-ip_forward'd packet (no NAT anywhere in this
#       topology) and so arrives with the CLIENT's own tunnel-assigned
#       address as its peer; a real TCP-lane flow is relayed via the
#       SERVER's own brand-new connect() (src/hybrid/tcp_egress.c's
#       svr_tcp_egress_start_connect) and can never carry the client's
#       tunnel address as ITS peer. Each flow also has its cumulative
#       received-byte count polled across the path bring-up + the other
#       flow's creation — the direct proof a sticky decision was never
#       silently re-evaluated mid-life (a reclassification bug would starve
#       an established flow's byte count instead of raising a clean error,
#       since lwIP has no pcb for a non-SYN packet on a 5-tuple it never saw
#       the SYN for).
#
# HTTP target addressing (Test 1): the client runs a full-tunnel default
# route (0.0.0.0/1 + 128.0.0.0/1 via TUN, src/platform/linux/routing.c) with
# ONE exception — a /32 host route pinning the VPN server's OWN transport
# address via the original interface (so the QUIC packets themselves don't
# recurse into the tunnel). Any address inside the veth path subnets
# (10.<oct>.0.0/24) is ALSO on-link on the client and bypasses the tunnel
# via the more-specific connected route. So the HTTP target must be an
# address that is: (a) not the pinned VPN transport address, (b) not inside
# any client-side on-link subnet, (c) not inside the CONNECT-IP tunnel
# subnet (rejected outright by the ACL's tunnel-subnet check), yet (d)
# reachable from the SERVER's own netns egress connect(). A /32 loopback
# alias in the server netns (10.222.0.1, disjoint from every subnet above)
# satisfies all four; EgressAllow punches it through the mandatory
# default-on RFC1918 deny (src/hybrid/tcp_egress.c DEFAULT_DENY_V4).
